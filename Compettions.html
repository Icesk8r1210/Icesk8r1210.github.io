        What are Figure Skating Compettions?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Skating competitions are a fun little twist to figure skating. Depending on your skill level, you can enter different
        skating competitions and compete against different skaters. Then the judges will decide which skaters did the best and 
        which ones did not do as good. Then after every one has skated, you get the results. That way you know where you stand
        up against the other skaters.
    </p>

        I love competitions. I always have so much fun no matter how good or bad I did. I am currently competing at the juvenile
        level. I was going to go to regionals this year, but it was canceled because of the virus. I also love to watch the
        skating competitions on TV too. My favorite skaters are Nathen Chen, Alysa Liu, and Mariah Bell. You should watch 
        figure skating too. If you're a figure skater, then you should try competing too.
