            A Little About Me!
        </h2>
        <p class= 'tab'>
            Hello everyone! My name is Emily. I like math, space, and of course, cats! I am a figure skater and 
            I really enjoy it! I am currently working on my Junior Moves In The Field. I was planning to go to regionals
            this year and compete at the juvenile level. Sadly it was canceled because of the Coronavirus. I can do a double
            sal, double toe loop, double loop, and a double flip. I am also working on my double lutz and double axel.
            I'm getting pretty close though.
        </p>
        <p class= 'tab'>
            Well, that's just a little bit about me! Stay tuned to hear about more of my adventures and fun with my friends!
        </p>

            I had a lot going on this week. My grandma left on Sunday to go back to her house. I also got my new skates on 
            Friday! I really like them. We also ate cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory! I also had online school on Monday, 
            Tuesday, and Wednesday. We ended up having in person school on Thursday and Friday. I missed school on Friday though
            because that was when I went to get my new skates. On Wednesday, my dad and I decided to go out and look at the sun
            with our telescope. It looked pretty cool! We also took some pictures. After he edited them, they looked even
            cooler! Other than that not much else happened.
