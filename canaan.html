        What Is Canaan Valley?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Canaan Valley is a super fun ski resort with lots of things to do. Activities include skiing, snow tubing, skating,
        gaming in the arcade, shopping, eating, and hot coco in the cabins! No matter what you decide to do, I'm sure you will
        have a great time. My friends, family, and I love to go to the nearby towns and shop. We go to Davis, and Tomas to
        shop and eat at restaurants.

        One of my favorite things to do, is to go ice skating on the outdoor rink. My friends and I really enjoy that alot.
        We also love snow tubing. It's super fun. You take your tube up the conveyor belt. Once you get to the top, you
        get to ride down. It goes super fast! We've never been on the ski slopes before, but we can't wait to try. I hope
        that you will try some of these activities too!
